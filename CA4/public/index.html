        <p>In 2022-2023 I worked with 3 other girls in a national competition called industrial cadets,
          where we, specifically, had to work with a local company to reduce their carbon footprint. 
          As part of our project, we built a conceptual webpage.

        <p>Whilst at university, I have joined the Nordic society, as I am fluent in both
          Finnish and English, the Badminton society and the ice-skating society, due to my
          love for sports. This semester i won bronze in two categories in our university
          ice-skating competition.

          I speak two languages fluently, including Finnish and English, and am also taking Spanish
          as a module in university, whilst studying Korean by myself on the side. Although I have 
          a long way to go, I love learning languages and i feel that they make life more interesting.

          As it can be seen from the logo, my favourite subject is Computing Science, which is why
          I have chosen it as my University subject. I fell in love with it in P6 when i joined
          my primary school's coding club and after finding out I had the opportunity to study
          it for my National 5's and my Highers, in which i had my favourite high school teacher
          who was an inspiration as she was the first female computing scientist I had ever known,
          I decided that I would make it my career.
