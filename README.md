Second assessment for first year Web Dev


# Development Approach:
- I chose to stick with a simple colour palette and a simple design as I felt that it didn't need to be extravagant to look nice.
- I added a logo to make the page stand out more as mine and to link it visually with the other pages.
- I used a navigation bar to link to the other pages for easy access.
- It was difficult to get the notifications working at first, but I eventually managed to get them to show up after much scouring of the internet. The typing... notification unfortunately I couldn't get to work, however, the other notifications work well, although I couldn't figure out how to get the correct username to show when they joined. I will work harder on fixing this in the future.
- Overall, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to make the notifications work and I think that next time I will seek help earlier to understand how to improve and what resources to use when I am in trouble.

# Challenges
- I found it challenging to figure out how to properly work the notifications and will definitely spend more time on that in the future.

# Technical details
- I found it difficult to use resources from online because of the constraint of the ready-made code. I found it difficult to figure out where the extra pieces of code went and sometimes how the javascript works. I believe that the chat application was an interesting project to have and I did really end up enjoying it. Although it doesn't have the typing... notification, I believe it looks professional and is not too hard on the eyes. The process took a long time, however it was worth it and one of my favourite things about computing is seeing the work you put in pay off.
